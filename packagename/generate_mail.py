            If there is no previous email, ignore the following instruction.

            Write a clear, professional, and personalized cold email in English, addressed to {prospect['main_contact']} ({prospect['contact_role']})
            at {prospect['company']}, located in {prospect['city']} and operating in the {prospect['sector']} sector.

            You are {freelance['name']}, a {freelance['title']} based in {freelance['city']}, specialized in the {freelance['main_sector']} sector.
            You provide services with expertise in {freelance['top3_skills']}, at a daily rate of {freelance['daily_rate']} EUR (remote: {freelance['remote']}).
            Your mission is: {freelance['mission_statement']}.

            The company is a {prospect['company_size']} at the {prospect['funding_stage']} stage, and remote work availability is {prospect['remote']}.

            The email should:
            - Open with a brief and relevant introduction.
            - Present the value you can bring in 2â€“3 concise sentences.
            - Be business-oriented and adapted to the company's context.
            - Match the company's tone: {prospect['target_tone']}, while also reflecting your preferred tone: {freelance['preferred_tone']} and style: {freelance['preferred_style']}.
            - End with a clear, actionable closing (e.g., propose a short call or ask for availability).
            - Sign the email with your name.

            Ensure the language is polite, direct, and free from repetition or generic phrases. Avoid placeholders or uncertain formulations.
            Return only the body of the email (no subject line or explanation).
